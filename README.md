# python-Automate
I will be uploading all the python scripts I will be using to make my life a little easier

## Download Python3:-
I made all of my projects using python3, it will be replaced in the future by its succesor but I belive the changes in the syntax will be minimal so if you have python version other than 3.X look out for changes in my code

To download python :- https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Automated emails
What I wanted to do was automate the task of sending email with same content(body,subject) to more than one people and with a image as a attachment so i created 3 programs for this task.
Please rember to change the directory according to your pwd if you use my code
### project5.py
(This was my project no 5 hence the name)

#### Important modules to download:-
1)yagmail:-
This will help you in automating the email sending procedure just type *pip install yagmail * to install the python module


2)keyring:-
This helped me with saving my gmail password. You can use this with any website you want to store the password. I used this so that I would'nt have to display my passcode for my account when i upload it the code on GitHub. Just type *pip install keyring * to download this module. Also set your password for your email in terminal not in your program

How to use this module read here :- https://alexwlchan.net/2016/11/you-should-use-keyring/

#### Description:-
This is the main part of the Automate program folder this is the part where the user will start the connection,register,enter the contents and  send the email. I used the for loop to send the email to multiple people

### imagedownload.py

I used this script to download google images in bulk without me having to manually download them 

just type *pip install google_images_download * to download the necessary packages.

How to use this module please read here:-https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download

### filerename.py
The images which were downloaded were named with different names and I wanted to rename them. For this I used the os module of python(it comes pre installed with python). I renamed all the images in a order so that I can use it in the for loop
